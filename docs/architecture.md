# **Project: Neural Sieve**

## **The High-Signal External Memory for AI Influence**

### **1\. The Core Philosophy**

Neural Sieve is a **filter, not a bucket**. It captures only "mind-blowing" insights—the 1% that change your perspective. It stores knowledge locally as plain-text **Knowledge Capsules**, making your wisdom accessible to any AI through context injection via a structured, logical map.

**Selection is the Verification:** There are no "Experimental" or "Verified" tiers. If an insight is captured, it is considered high-signal by definition.

### **2\. System Architecture (Local-First & Plain-Text)**

#### **A. The Directory Schema**

The vault uses a flat physical structure for safety, with logical grouping handled by the Indexing engine.

#### **B. The Knowledge Index (V1 Architecture)**

To ensure simplicity and stability in the initial version:

* **The Map:** A single `Capsules/INDEX.md` that categorizes all capsules. Auto-regenerated by the indexing engine on every file change.
* **Logical Tagging:** Instead of moving files physically (which risks path breakage), the engine uses YAML tags within the capsules to group related ideas.
* **Pinned Signal:** A dedicated "Eternal Truths" section in the index for capsules manually pinned by the user. These are the highest-priority context for any AI reasoning.

### **3\. The Technical Specification: The Knowledge Capsule**

Every piece of information is transformed into a "Knowledge Capsule"—a transparent, human-readable Markdown file. This format ensures the data is "future-proof" and easily parsed by both humans and LLMs.

**File Format:** \[ID\]\_\[SLUG\].md (e.g., 20260114\_neural\_sieve\_logic.md)

\# The Executive Summary  
\> A brief 2-sentence hook defining the core value of this insight for instant AI comprehension.

\# Core Insight  
The single most important "Aha\!" moment or fact contained in this capsule.

\# Full Content  
The complete, cleaned text for deep-dive reasoning. This section is stripped of ads, navigation noise, and irrelevant sidebars by gpt-5-mini.

\- Processing Logic: "Extracted as a logic diagram and converted to text."

### **4\. Key Features**

#### **A. Zero-Friction Capture**

Capturing is entirely silent and background-processed to ensure zero interruption to the user flow.

* **The Global Visual Capture:** A system shortcut triggers a screenshot. The image is saved to Inbox/.  
* **The Browser Brain:** One-click extension extracts "Clean Content" and saves it to Inbox/.  
* **The Intelligent Inbox:** A "Drop Zone" for dragging files, links, or text snippets directly into the processing pipeline.

#### **B. The Pin Rule**

The **Pin** is the ultimate signal of "immutability" and user intent.

* **Priority Logic:** Pinned capsules are immutable. Human intent (Pins) always overrides temporal recency.  
* **Context Injection:** When providing context to an LLM, Pinned capsules are always included as the primary "Truth" foundation.

#### **C. Semantic Compression (The "Tag Fold")**

* **Tag-Based Clustering:** The engine identifies overlapping insights and assigns them shared semantic tags.  
* **Logical Grouping:** Related capsules are presented together in `Capsules/INDEX.md` and the Management Dashboard without changing their physical location on the disk.
* **Immunity:** Pinned capsules are anchors. They are never "folded" or modified by the automated tagging engine.

### **5\. Lifecycle & Management (The Ghost Dashboard)**

A local-only web interface accessible via sieve manage serves as the primary hub for maintenance and exploration.

* **Knowledge Pinning:** The central place to elevate insights to "Pinned" status.  
* **The Vault Chat:** A chatbot interface that allows you to chat directly with your entire vault using a local RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) system.  
* **Cull:** Swiftly move capsules to the Legacy/ folder to remove them from active AI context.  
* **Export (Full Context):** Generates a single, combined Markdown file of your **entire active knowledge base**.

### **6\. The Influence Protocol (The Bridge)**

The system utilizes the **Model Context Protocol (MCP)** as the bridge to external AI agents.

* **Context Injection:** The AI reads `Capsules/INDEX.md` to understand the vault's structure and pulls Pinned and relevant capsules based on the query.
* **Direct Grounding:** The LLM receives Pinned truths as "System Constants" and handles any contradictions by prioritizing the Pinned content.

### **7\. Implementation Roadmap**

#### **V1: The Foundation (Current)**

1. **The Engine:** A Python background process managed via **uv**. It watches Inbox/ and uses **gpt-5-mini** for extraction and semantic tagging.  
2. **The Mapper:** Automatically regenerates `Capsules/INDEX.md` on every file change.
3. **One-Click Setup:** A setup.sh script using uv run to initialize the environment and global shortcuts.  
4. **The Ghost Dashboard:** Lightweight local server for sieve manage and Vault Chat.

#### **V2: Scale & Deep Integration**

1. **Recursive READMEs:** Introduction of nested maps for vaults exceeding 500+ capsules.  
2. **OpenCode Dependency:** Full integration with the OpenCode standard for structured code-traversal and deep reasoning across local codebases.  
3. **Proactive Folder Clustering:** Optional "Physical Folding" for users who prefer directory-level organization over flat tagging.
